# hostname-blocker-extension
A simple chrome extension that blocks the websites with the provided hostnames. I have used plain HTML, CSS and JS for the development. I have used the Chrome's local storage for storing data.

## Installation
Since the extension is not on the market, you can install it on your browser by navigating to `chrome://extensions` and uploading the extension folder.
